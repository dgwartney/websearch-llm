### "What are the size and weight limits for checked bags?"

**Standard Industry Limits:**

- **Size:** 62 linear inches (length + width + depth combined)
- **Weight:** 50 pounds per bag

Linear inches are calculated by adding together the length, width, and depth of your bag. For example, a bag measuring 4" long × 6" wide × 8" deep = 18 linear inches.

**Overweight Charges:**

- 51-70 lbs: $100-$200 extra
- 71-100 lbs: $200-$400 (advance notice typically required)
- Over 100 lbs: Usually prohibited

**Important Note:** Size and weight limits won't usually be a concern if you're traveling with standard luggage items like a suitcase. They're more relevant with large, awkward items like sports equipment and musical instruments.

### "How can I avoid baggage fees?"

**Option 1: Airline Credit Cards**

Most major airlines offer co-branded credit cards that waive baggage fees for:
- The cardholder
- Up to 9 passengers traveling on the same reservation

Though these cards typically charge an annual fee ($95-$250), the savings on baggage fees for even one or two trips can be substantial.

**Option 2: Achieve Elite Status**
Frequent flyer elite members receive benefits including:
- Free checked bags
- Priority boarding
- Seat upgrades

**Option 3: Choose Your Airline Wisely**
- Southwest offers 2 free checked bags for all passengers
- Some airlines waive fees for specific ticket classes (premium economy, business class, etc.)

**Option 4: Pre-Pay Online**
Many airlines offer discounts ($5-$10) if you pay for baggage online during the booking process rather than at the airport.

## Carry-On Baggage Questions

### "What can I bring as a carry-on?"

**Standard Allowance (Most Airlines):**
- 1 carry-on bag
- 1 personal item
- Both are typically FREE

**Size Limits (American Airlines example):**
- Carry-on: 22" × 14" × 9" (including handles and wheels)
- Personal item: Must fit under the seat (typically briefcase, purse, laptop bag, small backpack)

**Important Variation:**
United Airlines' Basic Economy does NOT allow a full-size carry-on—only a personal item. If you bring a larger bag to the gate, you may face a $25 gate handling fee on top of baggage fees.

**Helpful Tip:** Measure your luggage before traveling to ensure it meets your airline's specific dimension requirements.

## Lost or Delayed Baggage

### "What should I do if my bag is missing?"

**Immediate Steps (Don't leave the airport!):**

1. Wait for all bags to appear on the carousel
2. Speak to an airline representative immediately
3. File a claim in person
4. Obtain a claim number for tracking purposes
5. Ask about complimentary amenity kits (the airline may provide essentials like toothpaste, toothbrush, hand sanitizer, deodorant)

**Distinguishing Lost vs. Delayed:**

- **Delayed Baggage:** Hasn't arrived yet but may still show up
- **Lost Baggage:** Typically not declared "lost" until 5-21 days after your flight (varies by airline)

You're entitled to compensation for reasonable, verified expenses incurred while waiting for a delayed bag, including:
- Toiletries
- Change of clothing
- Emergency medications

### "How do I file a baggage claim?"

**What to Provide:**
- Flight information (flight number, date, airline)
- Baggage claim receipts
- Detailed description of each bag
- Receipts for items inside
- Valuations and appraisals (if applicable)
- Photos of your luggage (if available)

**Timeline:**
- Airlines typically investigate claims for 4 weeks to 3 months
- Allow up to 6 months for full investigation
- Claims requiring law enforcement investigation take longer

**Settlement Options:**
Airlines may offer:
- Cash payment (based on depreciated value, not replacement cost)
- Free airline tickets (ask about blackout dates and restrictions)
- Combination of both

**Important Note:** Airlines consider the depreciated value of your possessions, not their original price or replacement cost. Avoid exaggerating claims—airlines may completely deny inflated or fraudulent claims.

## Check-In Procedures

### "When should I check in my bags?"

**Standard Check-In Deadlines:**
- **Domestic Flights:** 30 minutes before scheduled departure
- **International Flights:** 1 hour before scheduled departure
- **Some Airlines:** Different requirements—check your airline's specific policy

**Earliest Check-In Time:**
Most airlines won't begin accepting baggage until 4 hours before scheduled departure.

**Finding Your Deadline:**
- Check your airline's website
- Review your e-ticket confirmation
- Call the airline customer service
- Look at your boarding pass

**Pro Tip:** Arriving at the airport 2-3 hours before domestic flights gives you plenty of time for check-in and security screening.

### "What security questions will I be asked at check-in?"

**Standard Security Questions (vary by airport/airline):**

1. "Did you pack your baggage yourself?"
2. "Has anyone asked you to carry anything on board for them?"
3. "Have you left your bags unattended at any time?"
4. "Are you traveling with any liquids?"
5. "Is there anything fragile in your bags?"

**Purpose of These Questions:**
These questions are designed to alert less experienced travelers to security requirements and ensure passengers know what's in their bags. They also serve as a federal offense if passengers lie about them.
